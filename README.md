Tiny example of 3D terrain loaded from heightmap using SOKOL.

Requirements:
- Go into `sokol` folder and run the `build_clibs_...` script for your platform. These bindings are from here: https://github.com/floooh/sokol-odin
- You need sokol shader compiler. I have included the window binary. For other platforms see: https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/blob/master/docs/sokol-shdc.md

When you have the requirements, run using `build.bat` or `build.sh` and then run the example.
